this script is a simple script that lets you use pyinstaller without prompting your console each time.
First you should have python installed and make sure to have set path
Then you should have installed pyinstaller on your system  
Now just double click the script it'll let you select a py file once done it'll run the py installer prompt using the -- onefile prompt.
futur version should let you use all the pyinstaller flavors.
